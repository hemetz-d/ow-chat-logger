## Structural Issues

### T-14 · `ocr_engine.py` legacy shim monkey-patches a module-level function in `__init__`
- **Severity:** structural
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/ocr_engine.py:20`
- **Completed:** —

`OCREngine.__init__` temporarily replaces `_windows._import_winrt_modules` with a local reference, calls `super().__init__()`, then restores the original. This pattern is not thread-safe: if two `OCREngine` instances are constructed concurrently, one thread's restore will overwrite the other's patch mid-construction. It appears to be a workaround for test isolation, but it pollutes production code with test machinery.

**Fix direction:** Investigate why the patch is needed and address the root cause. If it's purely for test mocking, use `unittest.mock.patch` in tests rather than patching in the constructor. Remove the monkey-patch from production code.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_ocr_engine.py` — verify the legacy `OCREngine` constructs correctly without the monkey-patch.

---

### T-20 · Save debug screenshot when a parsing anomaly is detected
- **Severity:** structural
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/pipeline.py`, `src/ow_chat_logger/live_runtime.py`
- **Completed:** —

When the OCR pipeline produces a suspicious result — e.g. a line falls through to `continuation` instead of matching a standard pattern, a player name is stripped by the `ocr_fix_closing_bracket_l` heuristic, or an empty OCR result is returned for a non-blank mask — there is currently no capture of the frame that caused it. Diagnosing these cases requires reproducing the exact screen state, which is often impossible after the fact.

**Fix direction:** Define an anomaly predicate (callable, configurable) that receives the `extract_chat_debug_data` return dict and returns `True` when the frame is considered anomalous. When triggered, save the cropped RGB image (and optionally the team/all masks) to a configurable directory (e.g. `debug_screenshots/`) with a timestamp filename. Wire the predicate into the live runtime loop after `extract_chat_lines`. Keep the save path and the predicate out of the hot path when not triggered.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_pipeline.py` — add a test that invokes the anomaly predicate with a synthetic debug dict containing a `continuation`-only parse result and confirms a file is written to a temp directory.

---

### T-30 · Improve team-chat color masking for blue-on-blue scenarios
- **Severity:** structural
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/image_processing.py` (team mask logic)
- **Completed:** —

In several screenshots (example_09, example_12, example_14) the team-chat text color is a blue shade very similar to the background. The current HSV mask cannot distinguish text from background at this color/brightness combination, so lines are never isolated and OCR produces nothing. Example_14 also shows pink panel text (`Odin's Fav Child`) bleeding into the team-chat crop, suggesting the mask accepts too broad a hue range.

**Fix direction:** Investigate the HSV ranges used for the team mask and compare against the failing screenshots. Consider: (a) widening the lightness range to catch slightly darker blue text; (b) adding a morphological close step before contour detection to bridge near-background-colored text; (c) adding a reject pass for out-of-range hues (e.g. pink/red) that are clearly not team-chat. This is a research-first task — inspect the debug mask images for example_09, example_12, and example_14 before changing thresholds.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_regression_screenshots.py` — example_09, example_12, and example_14 are the direct regression targets.

---

### T-31 · Duplicate frame-processing block in `live_runtime.py`
- **Severity:** structural
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/live_runtime.py:185-213`, `src/ow_chat_logger/live_runtime.py:273-294`
- **Completed:** —

`extract_chat_lines_for_live` and the inner body of `processing_worker` are near-identical: both resolve the profile on the hot path (`resolve_ocr_profile(dict(CONFIG))` if no profile was passed), build the same `debug_kwargs` (`should_run_ocr`, `pre_cropped=True`, optional `ocr_profile`), call `extract_chat_debug_data`, and emit the same multi-field `metrics.record_processed_frame(...)` payload. `extract_chat_lines_for_live` has no production call site — only tests reference it (`tests/test_live_runtime.py:253,286,324`). Any change to the frame-processing contract has to be made in two places.

**Fix direction:** Extract the shared block into a helper (e.g. `process_frame_debug(screenshot, ocr, profile, metrics, started)`) and have both `extract_chat_lines_for_live` and `processing_worker` call it. Alternatively, if `extract_chat_lines_for_live` is genuinely dead, delete it and migrate its tests to exercise `processing_worker` via a synthetic frame queue.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_live_runtime.py` — existing tests for `extract_chat_lines_for_live` become the contract test for the new helper.

## Smells

### T-10 · Dead commented-out code in `image_processing.py`
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/image_processing.py:91-100`
- **Completed:** —

An old `INTER_NEAREST` version of `clean_mask` lives as a comment block below the new `clean_mask` wrapper. It's unreachable and undocumented as an alternative.

**Fix direction:** Delete it. The new `clean_mask_steps` with `INTER_NEAREST` is already the active implementation; the comment is stale.

**Test surface:** No new tests needed. Verify existing image processing tests still pass.

---

### T-11 · CLI `--metrics` flag can only force-on, not force-off
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/main.py:11-14`, `src/ow_chat_logger/main.py:84`
- **Completed:** —

`--metrics` sets `metrics_enabled_override=True`. Absence passes `None`, deferring to config. There is no way to force-disable metrics from the CLI when `metrics_enabled: true` is set in user config.

**Fix direction:** Use `BooleanOptionalAction` (Python 3.9+) or add `--no-metrics` to allow explicit force-off. Update `create_metrics_collector` to accept `False` as a disable override.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_cli.py` — add a case for `--no-metrics` overriding config-enabled metrics.

---

### T-21 · `SYSTEM_PATTERNS` contains redundant `.*` prefixes
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/parser.py:33-49`
- **Completed:** —

All but one of the 15 entries in `SYSTEM_PATTERNS` use a `.*` prefix (e.g. `r".*left the game"`). `SYSTEM_REGEX` is compiled and searched via `SYSTEM_REGEX.search(line)`, which already scans the full string — the `.*` prefix is always redundant and makes the patterns harder to read.

**Fix direction:** Remove the `.*` from all pattern strings in `SYSTEM_PATTERNS`. No behavioral change.

**Test surface:** No new tests needed. Verify existing parser tests still pass.

---

### T-22 · `_effective_scale_factor` computed twice per resize call
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/image_processing.py:64-70`
- **Completed:** —

`clean_mask_steps` calls `_effective_scale_factor(cfg)` twice — once for `fx` and once for `fy` — in the same `cv2.resize` call. The function is deterministic for a given `cfg`, so this is safe but wasteful and inconsistent (if the function ever became non-deterministic, fx and fy could diverge).

**Fix direction:** Assign the result to a local variable once, then use it for both `fx` and `fy`.

**Test surface:** No new tests needed. Verify existing image processing tests still pass.

---

### T-25 · Inline error-case dict in `run_benchmark` duplicates `_unavailable_case` structure
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/benchmark.py:293-325`
- **Completed:** —

The `except Exception` branch in `run_benchmark` builds a 30-line inline dict that is structurally identical to the return value of `_unavailable_case`, differing only in `status: "error"`. This duplication means any schema change to benchmark result rows must be applied in two places. The error-case dict is also missing some fields relative to `_unavailable_case` (e.g. `fixture_path`, `expected_path` are present in `_unavailable_case` but the inline dict uses `str(png_path.resolve())` directly).

**Fix direction:** Extract an `_error_case(*, png_path, expected_path, profile_name, engine_id, message)` helper following the same signature pattern as `_unavailable_case`, with `status="error"`.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_benchmark.py` — verify error-case rows have the same schema as unavailable-case rows.

---

### T-32 · Stale "Related tasks" references in `KNOWN_FAILURES.md`
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `tests/fixtures/regression/KNOWN_FAILURES.md:64-72`
- **Completed:** —

The example_17 entry lists "Related tasks: T-27 (add hero-ban warning to SYSTEM_PATTERNS), T-28 (max vertical gap for continuation)". Both tasks are now `done` (2026-04-06). The entry must either be removed (if example_17 no longer fails) or updated with the current root cause — the text as written implies those fixes are still pending.

**Fix direction:** Re-run `pytest --run-ocr tests/test_regression_screenshots.py`, compare actual output for example_17 against the expected JSON, and either delete the entry or rewrite the root-cause explanation to reflect what remains after T-27 and T-28 landed.

**Test surface:** The regression suite itself is the test — whatever example_17 now emits is the ground truth for the updated note.

---

### T-33 · Undocumented regression failures for example_22, example_23, example_24
- **Severity:** smell
- **State:** 🔴 `open`
- **File:** `tests/fixtures/regression/KNOWN_FAILURES.md`, `tests/fixtures/regression/example_22.*`, `tests/fixtures/regression/example_23.*`, `tests/fixtures/regression/example_24.*`
- **Completed:** —

`pytest --run-ocr tests/test_regression_screenshots.py` reports 12 failures on master, but `KNOWN_FAILURES.md` only documents 9 of them (04, 05, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18). Three failing examples are undocumented:
- **example_22** (team_lines): expected `[A7X]: ich gärtnere im busch deiner muter` + `[A7X]: xd`, actual emits unrelated `[Kastelg]: hi gooners` + `[AN]: what is this` — suggests either a wrong `expected.json` or a coloring/crop misclassification.
- **example_23** and **example_24** (all_lines): both expect `[Power]: this is overwatch goodbye` followed by `[A7X]: epic!`, actual merges them into a single `[Power]: this is overwatch goodbye epicl` — looks like a missing-prefix / continuation-merge issue similar in shape to example_17.

**Fix direction:** Triage each of the three fixtures. For each, decide whether (a) the expected JSON is wrong and should be updated, (b) it reveals a real bug and should be split off into its own task, or (c) it's a genuine OCR/masking limitation that belongs in `KNOWN_FAILURES.md`.

**Test surface:** `tests/test_regression_screenshots.py` — these three examples.

## Deferred

### T-07 · `DEFAULT_ALLOWLIST` hardcoded for EN+DE regardless of language config
- **Severity:** structural
- **State:** ⚫ `deferred`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/ocr/easyocr_backend.py:7`
- **Completed:** —

Default allowlist contains German umlauts hardcoded; mismatches for other language configs. Deferred until a clean per-language character-set registry approach is designed.

---

### T-17 · T-15 fix creates false positive for legitimate player names ending in `l`
- **Severity:** bug
- **State:** ⚫ `deferred`
- **File:** `src/ow_chat_logger/message_processing.py:25`, `src/ow_chat_logger/parser.py`
- **Completed:** —

The `ocr_fix_closing_bracket` guard fires for players whose names legitimately end in `l` (e.g. `Daniel`, `Nathaniel`). Tradeoff accepted — the heuristic is correct far more often than it fires falsely. Deferred until OCR character-level confidence or a corpus-based player name check is available.
